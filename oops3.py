#The self Parameter
#The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.It is used to access properties and methods that belong to the class.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def greet(self):
    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("Emil", 25)
p1.greet()

#Why Use self? Without self, Python would not know which object's properties you want to access: The self parameter links the method to the specific object:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def printname(self):
    print(self.name)

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p2 = Person("Linus")

p1.printname()
p2.printname()

#self Does Not Have to Be Named "self",It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any method in the class: 

class Person:
  def __init__(myobject, name, age):
    myobject.name = name
    myobject.age = age

  def greet(abc):
    print("Hello, my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)
p1.greet()

#Accessing Properties with self
#You can access any property of the class using self:
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

  def display_info(self):
    print(f"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}")

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car1.display_info()

#Calling Methods with self
#You can also call other methods within the class using self:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def greet(self):
    return "Hello, " + self.name

  def welcome(self):
    message = self.greet()
    print(message + "! Welcome to our website.")

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p1.welcome()

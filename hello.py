print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")

#print("Python is fun!") print("Really!")this gives syntax error 

#You can use the print() function as many times as you want. Each call prints text on a new line by default:

#Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:

#If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter:

print("Hello World!", end=' ')
print("I will print on the same line.")

#However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:
print(3)
print(358)
print(50000)

#You can also do math inside the print() function:
print(3 + 3)
print(2 * 5)

#You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:
print("I am", 35, "years old.")

#For multiple comment use

#All classes have a built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created.

class Person:
   def __init__(self,name,age): 
      self.name = name
      self.age = name

p1 = Person("Emil",36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

#Note: The __init__() method is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.


#Why Use __init__()
#Without the __init__() method, you would need to set properties manually for each object:
class Person:
  pass

p1 = Person()
p1.name = "Tobias"
p1.age = 25

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

#You can also set default values for parameters in the __init__() method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age=18):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil")
p2 = Person("Tobias", 25)

print(p1.name, p1.age)
print(p2.name, p2.age)
